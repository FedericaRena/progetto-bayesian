### Ideas

1. *Bayesian model for playing poker (texas hold'em)*    
Our goal is to create a bayesian model for playing poker with an optimal but adaptive strategy. That is, we want our model to take decisions by studying multiple tasks: evaluating the probability of winning a certain round, understanding of to the opponents' strategy (ie try to see how much they are aggressive or conservative), adapting his own strategy to the players style of game, etc.

2. *Bayesian model to improve sports (maybe just football) betting strategies*   
Our goal is to create a bayesian model which can adapt his strategy of betting according to the evolution of the sport championship. We chose to focus on the Serie A football championship, and so the idea is to update our prior beliefs about who will win certain matches according to the trend of the teams in the season, their football statistics, etc.
