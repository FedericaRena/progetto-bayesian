### Ideas (with some links/references)

1. *Bayesian model for playing poker (texas hold'em)*    
Our goal is to create a bayesian model for playing poker with an optimal but adaptive strategy. That is, we want our model to take decisions by studying multiple tasks: evaluating the probability of winning a certain round, deciding if/when to call or raise and of what amount, understanding of to the opponents' strategy (ie try to see how much they are aggressive or conservative), adapting his own strategy to the players style of game, etc.

2. *Bayesian model to improve sports (maybe just football) betting strategies*   
Our goal is to create a bayesian model which can adapt his strategy of betting according to the evolution of the sport championship. We chose to focus on the Serie A football championship, and so the idea is to update our prior beliefs about who will win certain matches according to the trend of the teams in the season, their football statistics, etc. (I also really like this because there is a stream of data, so we can see better the "learning" process maybe)

3. *Exoplanetary classification*

4. Something from this maybe inspiring examples here

5. *ASHRAE - Great Energy Predictor III*
Youâ€™ll develop accurate models of metered building energy usage in the following areas: chilled water, electric, hot water, and steam meters. The data comes from over 1,000 buildings over a three-year timeframe. With better estimates of these energy-saving investments, large scale investors and financial institutions will be more inclined to invest in this area to enable progress in building efficiencies. (See more on Kaggle).
