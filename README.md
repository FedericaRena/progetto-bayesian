# Project A2
**Goal**: clustering weekly data of one year of PM10 (plus covariates - see AGRIMONIA project).  
**Repository structure** (meaning a summary of the most relevant folders):

- `data` constains, incredibly, all the datasets
- `Papers` contains the documents from which we guided our study and comprehension about the project tasks
- `src` contains all the codes 

<!-- - `report` and `Slides` contains materials about the project presentations -->
