### paper BayesianPoker
They say they didnt actually did a good work, so there is room for us.    
Their model just worked on two players, the bot and a second player, losed basically all matches against humans, while ok being a bit better than basic models (like a random player).

### paper Opportunities and challenges ecc
Here there are lots of ideas for projects if you want to read them. For example

- COVID-19 Vaccine risk-benefit calculator -> didnt read that part :)
- ReefCloud: A tool to monitor coral reefs worldwide -> similar to next one maybe
- Sampling Windows for Coral Reef Monitoring -> decide where to take measurements for coral reef, as the measurements cost so we dont want to waste money choosing "bad" positions
