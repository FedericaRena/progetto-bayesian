I write the summary here in a Rmd file as it can be rendered with html for better reading, and here i can include sections of code, math latex stuff, ecc.

# Paper 4
Not very useful, funny model on graphs, but it does not involve the use of covariates.

# Paper 5
Seems better for now. Still reading it.
